# Binance Moon Bot
This is a bot programed in Python and the idea is to optimize SELL and BUY orders taking into account the moon state:
- **FULL MOON**: Buy BTC :full_moon:
- **NEW MOON**: Sell BTC :new_moon:

However, guided by the motto **"better to gain a little than to lose a lot"**, if between the full moon and the new moon the price of BTC increases by 10% since the last purchase, then the bot is programmed to sell and thus obtain a considerable profit (more than 10%).
